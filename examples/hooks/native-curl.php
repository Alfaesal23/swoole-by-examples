/**
 * In this example, six non-blocking HTTP/1 requests are made by enabling option "SWOOLE_HOOK_NATIVE_CURL" and using
 * curl_multi_* functions.
 * Each request takes about two seconds to finish; however, since the requests are made in non-blocking mode, it takes
 * barely over two seconds to finish all the requests.
 *
 * Notes:
 *     * This feature works under Swoole 4.6.0+.
 *     * This approach works only if Swoole is installed with option "--enable-swoole-curl" included.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./hooks/native-curl.php"
 *
 * You can run following command to see how much time it takes to run the script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "time ./hooks/native-curl.php"
