/**
 * This example shows how to do multiprocessing without IPC (inter-process communication). It doesn't listen or
 * accept any external messages, and you should implement your business logic in the "workerStart" callback.
 *
 * This example creates a pool of size one (one process only in the pool), with three worker processes created
 * sequentially.
 *
 * To run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./pool/process-pool/pool-standalone.php"
