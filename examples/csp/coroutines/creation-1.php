/**
 * This example is to show how to create coroutines using different functions/methods:
 *     1. use the procedural function swoole_coroutine_create().
 *     2. use the method in OOP style: Swoole\Coroutine::create().
 *     3. use function \Swoole\Coroutine\go() from Swoole Library.
 *     4. use the short name go().
 *     5. use the short name of class \Swoole\Coroutine to call the create() method: Co::create().
 *
 * The four function/method calls are of the same thing:
 *     1. Function swoole_coroutine_create() is the one which actually creates a coroutine.
 *     2. Method Swoole\Coroutine::create() is an alias of function swoole_coroutine_create().
 *     3. Function \Swoole\Coroutine\go() proxies the call to method Swoole\Coroutine::create().
 *     4. Function go() is a short name of function swoole_coroutine_create().
 *     5. "co" is a short name of class \Swoole\Coroutine (thus method co::create() works the same as method Swoole\Coroutine::create()).
 *
 * The script creates 5 coroutines; each takes about 1 second to finish. The script takes about 1 second to finish.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "time ./csp/coroutines/creation-1.php"
