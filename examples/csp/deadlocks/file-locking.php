/**
 * This example shows how deadlock happens when trying to lock a locked file while the existing lock never gets released.
 *
 * In this example,
 *   1. Runtime hooks are enabled by default. Thus, filesystem functions (e.g., fopen(), flock(), etc) are hooked, and
 *      they work in a coroutine-friendly style.
 *   2. The file is locked at line 28.
 *   3. When function flock() is called for a second time at line 33, it waits for the lock to be released, and the coroutine
 *      yields its execution. However, there isn't a second coroutine running, thus the existing lock will never be released.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./csp/deadlocks/file-locking.php"
