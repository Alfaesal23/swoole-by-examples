/**
 * This example shows how deadlock happens when using the same \Swoole\Lock object across different coroutines.
 *
 * Different from other deadlock examples in this repository, this example does not show deadlock information (a fatal
 * error message from Swoole), making it hard to find out what's wrong.
 *
 * When using \Swoole\Lock objects in coroutines, make sure there is no coroutine context switching (to switch execution
 * between different coroutines) between method calls to lock() and unlock().
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./csp/deadlocks/swoole-lock.php" # It will run forever.
