/**
 * This example shows how to wait for a collection of coroutines to finish in PHP applications. It has 3 coroutines
 * executed, and takes about 3 seconds to finish.
 *
 * Class \Swoole\Coroutine\WaitGroup is defined in this file:
 *     https://github.com/swoole/library/blob/master/src/core/Coroutine/WaitGroup.php
 *
 * This example uses class \Swoole\Coroutine\WaitGroup, which is implemented using channels (class
 * \Swoole\Coroutine\Channel). Class \Swoole\Coroutine\WaitGroup works similar to class \Swoole\Coroutine\Barrier, which
 * doesn't use channels at all.
 * @see https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/barrier.php
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "time ./csp/waitgroup.php"
