/**
 * This example shows how to use channels to communicate among different coroutines.
 *
 * Key notes about channels:
 *     * The standard way to communicate among coroutines is to use channels.
 *     * A PHP channel can store any type of data, while in Golang a channel is for a specific type of data.
 *     * When a channel is full and you try to push new data into it, this push operation is paused until the channel is
 *       not full (or timeout happens).
 *     * When a channel is empty and you try to pop out data from it, this pop operation is paused until there are data
 *       available in the channel (or timeout happens).
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./csp/channel.php"
