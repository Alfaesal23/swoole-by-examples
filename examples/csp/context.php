/**
 * This example shows how to use Context objects in coroutines.
 *
 * The Context object of a coroutine is a key-value storage. It is used to store custom data for the coroutine.
 *
 * Each coroutine has a unique Context object automatically associated with it. The Context object of a coroutine can be
 * accessed by calling method `\Swoole\Coroutine::getContext()`; the object can be accessed from anywhere of current
 * process, as long as the associated coroutine still exists.
 *
 * The Context object will be automatically destroyed when the coroutine finishes execution and gets destroyed.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./csp/context.php"
 *
 * The output should look like the following:
 *     Name of the object in the Context object of coroutine #1: co1_obj
 *     Name of the object in the Context object of coroutine #2: co2_obj
 *
 *     Coroutine #2 is exiting. The context object of it will be destroyed.
 *     Object "co2_obj" is destroyed.
 *
 *     Coroutine #1 is exiting. The context object of it will be destroyed.
 *     Object "co1_obj" is destroyed.

    // Prior to PHP 8.2, items in the Context object of a coroutine could be set or accessed using dynamic properties,

    // The Context object of a coroutine works the same as an \ArrayObject object.
