/**
 * In this example we use APCu to count number of HTTP requests processed by each worker process in Swoole. From this
 * example, we can see that APCu caching in Swoole works the same way as in other PHP CLI applications, even when
 * multiple coroutines and multiple processes are involved.
 *
 * Here is how to run this example:
 * 1. First, let's make 499 HTTP requests to the server concurrently:
 *        docker compose exec -t client ab -n 499 -c 499 http://server:9513/
 *    With the above command, we make 499 HTTP requests to the server concurrently. The server uses APCu to store the
 *    number of HTTP requests processed by each worker process.
 * 2. Next, let's check the summary of all counters by making another HTTP request to the server:
 *        docker compose exec -t client curl http://server:9513/summary
 *    The server has 3 worker processes to process these requests. Hopefully we can see that each worker process
 *    processes different number of HTTP requests.
