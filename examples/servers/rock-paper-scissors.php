/**
 * In this example, we implement the classic hand game Rock Paper Scissors.
 *
 * Assuming there are three players A, B, and C, they choose their shapes separately by making a selection on the web
 * form and submitting their choices through following pages. Once everyone has their choices submitted, there will be
 * three HTTP POST requests made to the server.
 *
 *   * http://127.0.0.1:9801?name=A
 *   * http://127.0.0.1:9801?name=B
 *   * http://127.0.0.1:9801?name=C
 *
 * What happens next on the server side?
 *   1. The first two HTTP POST requests won't get responses immediately.
 *   2. Once all three HTTP requests are processed, they get responses simultaneously.
 *   3. All the responses are sent by the server when processing the third quest (the last request).
 *
 * For backend developers, instead of trying it using a web browser, you can execute following CLI commands in different
 * terminals and check the outputs:
 *   docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=client") curl -d "shape=Rock"     "http://server:9801?name=A"
 *   docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=client") curl -d "shape=Paper"    "http://server:9801?name=B"
 *   docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=client") curl -d "shape=Scissors" "http://server:9801?name=C"
