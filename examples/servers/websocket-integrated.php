/**
 * In this example we start a WebSocket server to demonstrate some advanced usages, where we have:
 *     * A WebSocket server to handle WebSocket requests.
 *     * A cronjob setup to run every 31 seconds.
 *     * A dedicated process to process task queues asynchronously.
 *
 * To test the WebSocket server, you can run following command to get a hello message back from the WebSocket server:
 *     docker compose exec -ti client bash -c "echo Swoole | websocat ws://server:9508"
 * To check logs created by the cron job and the asynchronous task queue process, you can run following command in the
 * console:
 *     docker-compose logs -f
