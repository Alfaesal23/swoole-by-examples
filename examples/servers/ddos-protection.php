/**
 * In this example we start an HTTP/1 server with DDoS protection enabled.
 *
 * DDoS protection in Swoole-based application server can be implemented by:
 *     1. setting option \Swoole\Constant::OPTION_ENABLE_DELAY_RECEIVE to true.
 *     2. using method \Swoole\Server::confirm() in the callback function of event "onConnect".
 *
 * For the HTTP server created in this example, 1/3 of the HTTP requests take about 2 seconds to finish; others
 * get HTTP responses back immediately.
 *
 * You can run following curl command to make HTTP/1 requests to the server:
 *   docker compose exec -t client bash -c "curl -i http://server:9510"
 *
 * To see how much time it takes before an HTTP response is returned from the server:
 *   docker compose exec -t client bash -c "time curl -s http://server:9510"
 *
 * To run a benchmark by making 50 HTTP requests concurrently:
 *   docker compose exec -t client bash -c "ab -n 50 -c 50 http://server:9510/"
