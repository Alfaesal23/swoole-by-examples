 * In this example, we will show how to block a coroutine in different ways. Please note that it only blocks current

 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./io/block-a-coroutine.php"
 *
 * You can run following command to see how much time it takes to run the script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "time ./io/block-a-coroutine.php"

        // be resumed. The method call will return false back and an error code is set on property $channel->errCode.
