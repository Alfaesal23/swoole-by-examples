/**
 * The example compares the return statements used in blocking function calls and non-blocking function calls.
 *
 * The output "123456" is printed out in following order:
 *     * The digit "1" is printed out first.
 *     * After one second, next four digits "2345" are printed out.
 *     * After another second, the last digit "6" is printed out.
 *
 * Notes:
 *     * Function blocking() executes in blocking mode, just like what we used to see.
 *     * Function nonBlocking() executes in non-blocking mode. It returns an integer value "5" back first before
 *       finishing executing the nested coroutine inside it.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./io/blocking-vs-non-blocking.php"

// NOTE: In most cases it's not necessary nor recommended to use method `Swoole\Event::wait()` directly in your code.
// The example in this file is just for demonstration purpose.
