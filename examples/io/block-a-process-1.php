/**
 * In this example, we will show how to block processes using method \Swoole\Atomic::wait() and \Swoole\Atomic::wakeup()
 * in a multiprocessing environment.
 *
 * How to run this script:
 *     docker compose exec -t client bash -c "./io/block-processes-using-swoole-atomic.php"
 *
 * There are other ways to block processes. Check following examples to see how to use class \Swoole\Lock to do it:
 * @see https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/io/block-a-process-using-swoole-lock.php
